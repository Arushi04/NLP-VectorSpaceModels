# NLP-VectorSpaceModels: 
We see how vector space models help to identify similar sentences with different words and also helps capture dependency between the words.

Similarity Metrics used :
1. Euclidean distance
2. Cosine Similarity
3. Manipulated word vectors to find the relationship between 2 words based on a given relationship. Eg : King - Man + Woman = Queen

### Concepts covered:
* Word Embeddings Manipulation (Vector Space Model)
* Principal Component Analysis implementation
* Finding word analogies using different similarity metrics

### Requirements
* Python 3.6.10  
* Numpy 1.18.4  
* Pandas 1.0.5
* Matplotlib 3.2.1
* NLTK 3.5
* Scikit-learn 0.23.1

### Result:   
Model accuracy : 92.0
